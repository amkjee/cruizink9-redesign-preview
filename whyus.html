                        Lori with Cruizin K9 is THE best! I have tried the
                        traditional dog daycare for my girl, Jersey, but she is
                        just so much happier to go on these hikes with Lori and
                        a group of other dogs. She just adores Loriâ€¦. maybe more
                        than she adores me??! Ha!
                        <br /><br />
                        We also use their 'pit stop' service when a hike doesn't
                        happen. I feel content while I'm at work knowing that
                        Jersey is happy and well cared for.
                        <br /><br />
                        Lori is professional and organized and I trust her
                        completely with my girl. ðŸ’œ

                        Our pup, Tucker, started with Cruizink9 in 2022, after
                        we moved to Kamloops. We all had to adapt to our new
                        home, and Tuck was no exception (he left behind his
                        brother). He was super sad and it showed! Lori was
                        determined to make things better, and in no time, Tucky
                        found a new tribe and now has many friends he gets to
                        see often. Lori is so genuine, and she truly cares about
                        each of her "clients". Tucker definitely sees her place
                        as his home away from home, and we're grateful to have
                        her when we go out of town (as Tucky doesn't like to
                        travel). Lori has been extremely accommodating and she's
                        the first person I'd recommend for any fur baby.

                        We met with Lori of Cruizin K9 when Freya (our German shepherd) was just over a year old. This was an anxious age for her, and she had a lot of puppy energy, so exercise and socialization were very important to us.
During our first meet and greet with Lori, Freya's nervousness caused her to bark quite a lot.   I felt disappointed thinking she wouldn't fit in the group.  Thank goodness Lori didn't give up and returned the next day and spent some one on one time with Freya.  Since that day their relationship has blossomed. 
Lori is a truly a professional who is knowledgeable, caring and loves dogs.  She ensures the dogs in each group get along and when out on a run sends us pictures of Freya and her furry friends having the time of their lives.
If I mention Lori's name now,  Freya becomes very excited and waits by the door or waits to see the van at the window.
I trust Lori and Cruizin K9 with our girl and know Freya is always in good hands.

A very happy client.

                        My dogs howl with delight every time Lori and Kristie
                        come to the door to pick them up and I'm honestly not
                        sure who seems happier about the walk between the dogs
                        and the girls! I would highly recommend (and have many
                        times to friends) Cruizin K9 as one of the best animal
                        care service providers in town.
