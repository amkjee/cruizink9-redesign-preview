                        Lori with Cruizin K9 is THE best! I have tried the
                        traditional dog daycare for my girl, Jersey, but she is
                        just so much happier to go on these hikes with Lori and
                        a group of other dogs. She just adores Lori…. maybe more
                        than she adores me??! Ha!
                        <br /><br />
                        We also use their 'pit stop' service when a hike doesn't
                        happen. I feel content while I'm at work knowing that
                        Jersey is happy and well cared for.
                        <br /><br />
                        Lori is professional and organized and I trust her
                        completely with my girl. 💜

                        Our pup, Tucker, started with Cruizink9 in 2022, after
                        we moved to Kamloops. We all had to adapt to our new
                        home, and Tuck was no exception (he left behind his
                        brother). He was super sad and it showed! Lori was
                        determined to make things better, and in no time, Tucky
                        found a new tribe and now has many friends he gets to
                        see often. Lori is so genuine, and she truly cares about
                        each of her "clients". Tucker definitely sees her place
                        as his home away from home, and we're grateful to have
                        her when we go out of town (as Tucky doesn't like to
                        travel). Lori has been extremely accommodating and she's
                        the first person I'd recommend for any fur baby.

                        We met with Lori of Cruizin K9 when Freya (our German
                        shepherd) was just over a year old. This was an anxious
                        age for her, and she had a lot of puppy energy, so
                        exercise and socialization were very important to us.
                        During our first meet and greet with Lori, Freya's
                        nervousness caused her to bark quite a lot. I felt
                        disappointed thinking she wouldn't fit in the group.
                        Thank goodness Lori didn't give up and returned the next
                        day and spent some one on one time with Freya. Since
                        that day their relationship has blossomed. Lori is a
                        truly a professional who is knowledgeable, caring and
                        loves dogs. She ensures the dogs in each group get along
                        and when out on a run sends us pictures of Freya and her
                        furry friends having the time of their lives. If I
                        mention Lori's name now, Freya becomes very excited and
                        waits by the door or waits to see the van at the window.
                        I trust Lori and Cruizin K9 with our girl and know Freya
                        is always in good hands. A very happy client.

                        come to the door to pick them up and I'm honestly not
                        sure who seems happier about the walk between the dogs
                        and the girls! I would highly recommend (and have many

                        care service providers in town.

                        hikes, they also go above and beyond whenever your

                        There was one time that the roads back to our place were
                        closed so they couldn’t drop of our dog after their
                        hike. No problem, Kristie said, they just took our dog
                        back to her place for the afternoon. It’s such a relief
                        knowing our dogs are in great hands.
                        <br />
                        With two black labs, they get into a lot of things, and
                        more then once Lori and Kristie have attended to
                        spontaneous upset tummies. Don’t look any further,
                        Cruizin K9 will surpass your expectations.

                        Lori at Cruizin K9 has been looking after my two girls
                        for about 3 years.
                        <br />
                        Both my girls are rescues and are very cautious of new

                        <br />
                        I don't always know my schedule and Lori is always there
                        for me. I have never had anyone else take care of my
                        girls and they love Lori as much as we do.

                        We have been using Cruizin K9 for dog-walking our
                        adopted Shepherd since Fall 2016. Storm was a very
                        energetic 14 month old rescue from the SPCA when we
                        first started using Lori and despite very little history
                        and some work on manners needed, Lori embraced him. His
                        weekly “Lori Days” are the highlight of his week and
                        when I start reminding him he starts getting
                        super-excited.
                        <br /><br />
                        Lori managed to align with the days that make the most
                        sense to me (when I am out of the home working) and
                        Storm is always clearly happily worn out when he gets
                        back – just snores the rest of the day! Lori has access
                        to the house to pick him and up and drop him home and
                        always ensures our home is safely secured.
                        <br /><br />
                        Really, I can't say enough good things about Lori. I pay
                        through e-banking, she comes and picks him up, gives him
                        a great run and everyone is happy. Super-simple,
                        super-reliable.
                        <br /><br />
                        And there can be no better testament from Storm than the
                        fact that on several occasions he has clean refused to
                        get out of the van when he gets back home. He loves his
                        ‘Lori Days’!

                        I first met Lori at Cruizin K9 shortly after we brought
                        home our Bernese Mountain Dog puppy, Lenix. We were
                        looking for a way to socialize our pup with other dogs
                        and have her get a little bit of extra exercise on a
                        weekly basis.
                        <br /><br />
                        I immediately knew that I had found the right company,
                        as Lenix flourished and has grown to be a well behaved
                        dog in the past 2.5 years! Cruizin K9 is a very reliable
                        company and the safety of the dogs is paramount.
                        <br /><br />
                        There have been a few times when Lenix has been on
                        restricted exercise, and each time we ask Lori to ensure
                        she doesn’t rough with the other dogs, Lenix is kept on
                        a leash to prevent further aggravation of the injury.
                        <br /><br />
                        We value and appreciate the service that Cruizin K9
                        provides, as we feel that Lenix is a part of their
                        family too!

                        We have been having Cruizin K9 walking our little dog
                        two or more days a week since we moved to Kamloops over
                        two years ago.
                        <br /><br />
                        He loves his walks and looks forward to going every
                        time. Lori and Kristie are awesome with him, and all of
                        their doggy clients.
                        <br /><br />
                        They are exceptionally dependable, caring and friendly.
                        When our plans change there is never a problem with them
                        adapting to our needs. We love that our little dog is so
                        well cared for by these outstanding people. Five stars
                        for Cruizin K9.
                        <br /><br />
                        I would recommend them to anyone who wants quality care,
                        socialization and exercise for their 4 legged family
                        members.

                        Lori and Cruizin K9 have been a lifesaver!
                        <br /><br />
                        When we moved to Westsyde last spring, we didn’t know
                        anyone and needed to find a solution for our sweet Maggi
                        on those days that everyone was at work or school.
                        <br /><br />
                        After driving by the Cruizin K9 van for several days, I
                        researched, read reviews and decided to give Lori a
                        call. As soon as she walked in our door Maggi was in
                        love!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The flexibly and professionalism that Lori shows is
                        outstanding. She always goes above and beyond and treats
                        Maggi like her own fur baby.
                        <br /><br />
                        Thank you Lori and Cruizin K9!

                        Cruizin K9 have been taking our little girl Cloe on
                        adventures for over 7 years. I think she was possibly
                        the first client of Cruizin K9.
                        <br /><br />
                        I will always remember the first time that Lori came to
                        our house to take Cloe. Our shy little 6-month-old puppy
                        ran to her and jumped into her arms and that’s when I
                        knew we had made the right choice and am so thankful to
                        have found her. The love and care that Lori and her crew
                        with her has had a huge impact in ensuring that we have
                        a happy and social little dog.
                        <br /><br />
                        Cloe loves going with "the gang" in the van and the
                        pictures that Cruizin K9 sends to us not only shows how
                        much fun goes on, but it also gives me comfort in
                        knowing that Cloe while I am at work, she is getting out
                        with her friends and socializing (one of her favorite
                        pastimes!). On occasion (more than a few), I have called
                        Cruizin K9 at the last minute and Lori has always found
                        a way to get out and take Cloe on a hike or pee break.
                        <br /><br />
                        Good weather or bad, Cruizin K9 has always been here for
                        us. I cannot imagine our lives without Lori, her crew
                        and all of Cloe's hiking buddies.

                        come to the door to pick them up and I'm honestly not
                        sure who seems happier about the walk between the dogs
                        and the girls! I would highly recommend (and have many
                        times to friends) Cruizin K9 as one of the best animal
                        care service providers in town.
